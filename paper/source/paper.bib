  title     ={Detecting spatial structures in throughfall data: The effect of
               extent, sample size, sampling design, and variogram estimation
               method},
  author    ={Voss, Sebastian and Zimmermann, Beate and Zimmermann, Alexander},
  abstract  ={In the last decades, an increasing number of studies analyzed
               spatial patterns in throughfall by means of variograms. The
               estimation of the variogram from sample data requires an
               appropriate sampling scheme: most importantly, a large sample
               and a layout of sampling locations that often has to serve both
               variogram estimation and geostatistical prediction. While some
               recommendations on these aspects exist, they focus on Gaussian
               data and high ratios of the variogram range to the extent of the
               study area. However, many hydrological data, and throughfall
               data in particular, do not follow a Gaussian distribution. In
               this study, we examined the effect of extent, sample size,
               sampling design, and calculation method on variogram estimation
               of throughfall data. For our investigation, we first generated
               non-Gaussian random fields based on throughfall data with large
               outliers. Subsequently, we sampled the fields with three extents
               (plots with edge lengths of 25 m, 50 m, and 100 m), four common
               sampling designs (two grid-based layouts, transect and random
               sampling) and five sample sizes (50, 100, 150, 200, 400). We
               then estimated the variogram parameters by method-of-moments
               (non-robust and robust estimators) and residual maximum
               likelihood. Our key findings are threefold. First, the choice of
               the extent has a substantial influence on the estimation of the
               variogram. A comparatively small ratio of the extent to the
               correlation length is beneficial for variogram estimation.
               Second, a combination of a minimum sample size of 150, a design
               that ensures the sampling of small distances and variogram
               estimation by residual maximum likelihood offers a good
               compromise between accuracy and efficiency. Third, studies
               relying on method-of-moments based variogram estimation may have
               to employ at least 200 sampling points for reliable variogram
               estimates. These suggested sample sizes exceed the number
               recommended by studies dealing with Gaussian data by up to 100
               \%. Given that most previous throughfall studies relied on
               method-of-moments variogram estimation and sample sizes ≪200,
               currently available data are prone to large uncertainties.},

  abstract = {A wide range of basic and applied problems in water resources research requires high-quality estimates of the spatial mean of throughfall. Many throughfall sampling schemes, however, are not optimally adapted to the system under study. The application of inappropriate sampling schemes may partly reflect the lack of generally applicable guidelines on throughfall sampling strategies. In this study we conducted virtual sampling experiments using simulated fields which are based on empirical throughfall data from three structurally distinct forests (a 12-year old teak plantation, a 5-year old young secondary forest, and a 130-year old secondary forest). In the virtual sampling experiments we assessed the relative error of mean throughfall estimates for 38 different throughfall sampling schemes comprising a variety of funnel- and trough-type collectors and a large range of sample sizes. Moreover, we tested the performance of each scheme for both event-based and accumulated throughfall data. The key findings of our study are threefold. First, as errors of mean throughfall estimates vary as a function of throughfall depth, the decision on which temporal scale (i.e. event-based versus accumulated data) to sample strongly influences the required sampling effort. Second, given a chosen temporal scale throughfall estimates can vary considerably as a function of canopy complexity. Accordingly, throughfall sampling in simply structured forests requires a comparatively modest effort, whereas heterogeneous forests can be extreme in terms of sampling requirements, particularly if the focus is on reliable data of small events. Third, the efficiency of trough-type collectors depends on the spatial structure of throughfall. Strong, long-ranging throughfall patterns decrease the efficiency of troughs substantially. Based on the results of our virtual sampling experiments, which we evaluated by applying two contrasting sampling approaches simultaneously, we derive readily applicable guidelines for throughfall monitoring.}
