# Example notebooks

Rather than strictly providing definitions and usage examples, as in the `How To` section, several Jupyter notebooks have been provided here to provide an interactive turotial experience.

These notebooks are packaged with the `canoPyHydro` package, and will therefore be cloned along side the rest of the repo when using git. The notebooks can also be downloaded individually from the `code_samples/notebooks` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wischmcj/canopyHydrodynamics.git
cd canopyHydrodynamics/docs/source/examples/
```

Note that if you're running locally, in order to run the code in the workflows, you will also need to install the canoPyHydro package from pip. Please refer to the [getting started page](https://canopyhydrodynamics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) for help getting started.
