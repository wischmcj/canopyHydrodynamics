    "## Cylinder Overlap (Shade)\n",
    "\n",
    "  In order to better understand how the branches of a tree's canopy overlap, more granular overlap information has also been made available via the 'find_overlap_by_percentile' function.\n",
    "  When considered from a birds eye view (projecting onto the XY plane), this concept can be understood as a facsimile for the 'shade' cast by branches at a certain height in the tree canopy.\n",
    "  Consider the below example\n",
    "    * Add example\n",
    "    The percentile list is used to determine the height at which to calculate shade. As such, the function will look at the overlap between cylinders in the 75%ile by height (in red) with the remaining cylinders (in blue). The returned values thus represent the 'shade' case by the red cylinders on the blue cylinders.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Following this logic if either the 0%ile or 100%ile is requested, then there will be no overlap reported. In the former case, all cylinders are included in the red group and therefore there are no blue cylinders on which to cast shade. In the latter case, all cylinders are in the blue group and so there are no red cylinders to cast shade onto the blue cylinders.\n",
    "\n",
    "  When considered in the XZ or YZ direction, this calculation can be useful in determining the wind exposure at different canopy depths."
