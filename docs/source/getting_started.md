# Getting started

## Installation

`canoPyHydro` can be installed using pip. This installs our latest stable release with fully-supported features. `canoPyHydro` currently supports Python versions 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11.

```bash
$ pip install canoPyHydro
```

You can also install the latest development version by cloning the GitHub repository and using pip to install from the local directory:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/canoPyHydro/canoPyHydro.git
```
<!-- 
In addition, we provide a reproducible computational environment using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/canoPyHydro/canoPyHydro-binder/HEAD), where you can execute the example notebooks without the need to install the canoPyHydro package or ParFlow. Please note that the Binder project has limited resources, so this is not an appropriate place to run large simulations - but it's a great environment to get started with the canoPyHydro API. Note that Binder may take several minutes to launch. -->
