**canoPyHydro**  seeks to empower researchers with percipitation partitioning data - leveraging
evermore widely available terrestrial lidar scans (TLS) to provide detailed estimates of water
distribution throughout (and below) tree canopies. Users can not only use this tool to generate industry
standard metrtics, they can push the boundaries of canopy characterization with with a variety of
innovative visualization and analytics tools.
