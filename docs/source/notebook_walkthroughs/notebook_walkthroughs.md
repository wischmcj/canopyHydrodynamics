Example notebooks
=================

Rather than strictly providing definitions and usage examples, as in the `How To` section, several Jupyter notebooks have been provided here to provide an interactive turotial experience.

These notebooks are packaged with the `canoPyHydro` package, and will therefore be cloned along side the rest of the repo when using git. The notebooks can also be downloaded individually from the `code_samples/notebooks` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wischmcj/canopyHydrodynamics.git
cd canopyHydrodynamics/code_samples/notebooks
```
These notebooks can be run on your local machine. Clone the `canoPyHydro` repo or download an individual notebook from GitHub, and run the notebooks with a kernel that has the package pip-installed. Note that if you're running locally, in order to complete some workflows, you will also need to install the canoPyHydrp package from pip Please refer to the [canoPyHydro](https://canoPyHydro.org/) for help getting started.
