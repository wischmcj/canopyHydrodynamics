CanoPyHydro's estimations of precipitation partitioning rely on the identification of 'drip-points' in the canopy. Drip points are locations in the tree canopy that water flowing towards the stem of the tree cannot pass, due to the branch angle becoming too steep. Which partition (stemflow,throughfall) each portion of the tree contributes intercepted precipitation to then relies on their being path from that portion of the tree to the stem of the tree, on which the branch angle allows for the flow of water. To identify these 'too-steep' portions of the tree, we choose a 'drip cut-off angle' (configurable by the user) such that angles more negative than this cutoff do not allow for the flow of intercepted percipitation.  Aflow of water is assumed to flow towards the stem unless the angle of an encountered branch is less than the drip cutoff angle.
A digraph is then constructed with each edge representing one cylinder, with edges oriented in the presumed direction of flow  under these assumptions This graph is then traversed, and each cylinder is marked as either contributing to stem flow  - if the stem can be reached from its corresponding edge in the graph - or drip flow - if not.
